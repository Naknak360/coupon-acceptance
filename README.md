# Report on Coupon Acceptances

## Bar Coupon Acceptances
Based on my observations about bar coupons, I believe that there is a strong 
correlation between drivers accepting bar coupons if they have a history of 
going to bars at least once a month. Through all of the different investigations, 
the one trait that has always shown a high bar coupon acceptance rate is from 
drivers who frequent bars. However, I would like to believe that age has an 
important role in whether or not a driver accepts a bar coupon. However, I would 
like recommend investigating the value of age and seeing if there is a correlation 
there. This is because the data generalizes ages very drastically, and I would 
like more precise ages or their groupings in order to determine the age 
demographic of bar coupon accepters. 

## Does time of day impact which types of coupons are more likely to be accepted?
For my individual investigation problem, I chose to investigate whether the time 
of day plays a significant role in what kind of coupon a driver is more willing 
to accept. I hypothesize that drivers who are sampled at around 6PM are more 
likely to accept restaurant or carry-out coupons while drivers at 7AM or 10AM 
are more likely to accept coffee coupons. I also hypothesize that drivers 
sampled at 10PM are likely to accept bar coupons.


However, it turns out that my original hypothesis was wrong. By utilizing heat
maps and acceptance proportion findings, I realized that although there may be
a small correlation between time and the types of coupons accepted for certain
categories of coupons, this cannot be generalized to the entire suite of 
coupons that were accepted by drivers. In fact, my findinigs point towards more
of a correlation between the type of coupon on whether the coupon was more
likely to be accepted.
